Homework 1

Have a new class called VisitingStudent. A VisitingStudent is a kind of a student
with a country and a native language. The VisitingStudent has country and 
nativeLanguage properties, the appropriate constructors, and a toString() method 
that includes the country and native language.

Modify ex9.java from the first set of notes to include visiting students initially 
and we can also add them. The new filename should be <lastname>1.java 
(for example, avitabile1.java).

When you finish, make a zip file that includes your application, project, and 
java files. It should contain everything, not just the java files. Also, 
tell me what version of JDeveloper you created it with. Do this for all 
homework assignments.
